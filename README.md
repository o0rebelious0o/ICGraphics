Code repository for OpenGL Graphics

This is my repository for working on graphics rendering using glut and openGL.

When running the program, press 'r' to toggle visible light source, 't' to toggle texturing, and 'y' to toggle redering of the world coordinate axis.
wasd move closer/further from the face and rotate the camera, q/e raises or lowers the camera.
ijkl and u/o do the same thing but for the dynamic light source.

This work is my own property, do not copy it without asking my permission as this is work related.
